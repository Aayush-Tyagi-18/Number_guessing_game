🎮 Number Guessing Game in C

📜 Project Overview
The Number Guessing Game is a simple, yet engaging console-based game built in the C programming language. The player is tasked with guessing a randomly generated number within a specified range, with the program providing hints on whether the guessed number is too high or too low.

🔢 How the Game Works
The program generates a random number within a specified range.
The player inputs their guess.
The program provides feedback:
"Too High" if the guess exceeds the number.
"Too Low" if the guess is below the number.
"Correct!" when the guess matches the number.
The game continues until the correct number is guessed.
